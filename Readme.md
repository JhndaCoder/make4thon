# Sahaya

## Project  Description :
<p> Sahaya is particularly aimed at solving some of the major issues an army person faces in a base camp. The major solutions we are trying to add in this project are :
1.Providing a system capable of allowing users to communicate using a Bluetooth based mesh network at a time of no cellular network availability. <br>
2.Required person can update information like food, medical facility, etc. and accordingly forward the requests to authorities. <br>
3. Interface for the control room to monitor the soldier’s last position and movement when under network. <p\> <br>
  
## Note:
<p> 1.The project is being created as a prototype for Make4thon under the “Defence” track. <br>
2.Because of limited tech stack and time constraint, we may not be able to add all the features we planned but we will surely work on it after the hackathon. <br>
3.The project requires a mobile application model for its functioning but for the prototype we are creating mobile responsive web app model. <p/> <br>
